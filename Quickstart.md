# 🎯 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Created

Your CNN project is now **fully structured and ready to run**! Here's what I've set up for you:

### 📁 Project Structure

```
cnn/
├── venv/                     ✅ Virtual environment (created)
├── main.py                   ✅ Complete Jupyter notebook (23 cells!)
├── requirements.txt          ✅ All dependencies listed
├── setup.ps1                 ✅ Automated setup script
├── README.md                 ✅ Project documentation
└── QUICKSTART.md            ✅ This file!
```

### 📓 Notebook Contents (main.py)

Your notebook has **23 cells** organized as follows:

1. **Introduction** - Project overview and objectives
2. **Import Libraries** - PyTorch, matplotlib, numpy, tqdm
3. **Load CIFAR-10 Dataset** - Automatic download and preparation
4. **Visualize Data** - Display sample images with labels
5. **Build CNN Model** - 3 Conv layers + 3 FC layers architecture
6. **Configure Training** - Loss function, optimizer, scheduler
7. **Train Model** - 10 epochs with progress bars
8. **Plot Training Progress** - Loss and accuracy graphs
9. **Evaluate on Test Set** - Overall and per-class accuracy
10. **Visualize Predictions** - See correct and incorrect predictions
11. **Save Model** - Save trained weights for later use
12. **Summary** - Project completion and next steps

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

```powershell
# Run the automated setup script
.\setup.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```powershell
# 1. Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install packages
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy tqdm

# 3. Open main.py and run cells!
```

## 🎮 Running the Notebook

1. **Open `main.py`** in VS Code
2. **Click on any cell** to select it
3. **Press `Shift + Enter`** to run the cell and move to next
4. **Watch the magic happen!** 🎉

### Expected Outputs:

✅ **Cell 1** (Imports): Device info, PyTorch version  
✅ **Cell 2** (Data): Downloads CIFAR-10 (170 MB, one-time)  
✅ **Cell 3** (Visualize): Grid of 16 colorful images  
✅ **Cell 4** (Model): Network architecture summary  
✅ **Cell 5** (Config): Optimizer and loss function  
✅ **Cell 6** (Train): Progress bars for 10 epochs (~5-15 min)  
✅ **Cell 7** (Plot): Beautiful loss/accuracy graphs  
✅ **Cell 8** (Test): Overall accuracy (~70-75%)  
✅ **Cell 9** (Predictions): Visual comparison grid  
✅ **Cell 10** (Save): Model saved to disk

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Run cells in order** - Each cell builds on previous ones
2. **First run downloads data** - CIFAR-10 is ~170MB (one-time)
3. **Training takes time** - 5-15 minutes depending on CPU/GPU
4. **Use GPU if available** - Much faster training!
5. **Expected accuracy** - 70-75% test accuracy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Module not found"

**Solution**: Make sure you activated the virtual environment and installed packages

### Problem: "CUDA out of memory"

**Solution**: Reduce batch size in the DataLoader (line ~57)

### Problem: Slow training

**Solution**: Normal on CPU! Use GPU or reduce epochs

## 📊 Publishing to Jupyter Notebook

The file `main.py` is **already a Jupyter notebook** (.ipynb format)!

To share online:

1. **GitHub**: Push to GitHub, it will render automatically
2. **Google Colab**: Upload main.py to Colab
3. **Binder**: Use mybinder.org to create a live link
4. **nbviewer**: Share via nbviewer.jupyter.org

---

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Everything is set up and ready. Just run:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

Then open `main.py` and start running cells!

**Happy Learning! You've got this! 🚀**
